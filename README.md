# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Small-Datasets

Sentiment analysis is an impeccably important tool used by firms in industry to quantify consumer
feedback, which is usually conducted using various algorithmic techniques on social media
data. This is particularly essential for startup service-oriented firms that do not have the resources
to conduct widespread market analysis in the field. The literature in the field of sentiment
analysis is extremely thorough and comprehensive, however previous research has almost always
assumed a large dataset of user generated social media data for sentiment analysis, which startups
do not possess. This report attempts to apply, optimize and rigorously evaluate state-of-the-art
sentiment analysis techniques on a small twitter dataset of no more than 600 tweets.
In order to ensure empirically reliable results, five different startup datasets are classified
by various machine learning algorithms and deep learning neural network using two different
feature extraction techniques: TFIDF and pre-trained word embeddings. Although a small
labelled dataset generally reduced classification performance, the results of this study establish
that Support Vector Machine is the most optimal classification model for small dataset sentiment
analysis, achieving a classification accuracy score of 75%.
